Agent-based models - computational models that simulate complex social interactions - have become a well established simulation tool in the social sciences, but until recently their potential within the spatial sciences has been limited.  This pioneering text, pulled together by an expert team of authors demonstrates how agent-based modelling can be integrated with geographical information systems (GIS) to produce new insights on complex geographical phenomena, from patterns of urban growth to trends in mobility, population dynamics and health. 

Providing step-by-step guidance and packed full of practical examples, Agent-Based Modelling and Geographic Information Systems will show you: 

 - The fundamental theory and potential applications of agent-based modelling 
 - How to design, develop and build agent-based models 
 - The how and why of integrating agent-based modelling with GIS 
 - How agent-based models allow us to study connections between people and places 
 - How to evaluate agent-based models 

Supported by an online code repository and additional materials, enabling you to walk through the examples in the text, this book will give you the essential knowledge and practical skills required for building and running your own agent-based models for simulating geographical systems.
