Andrew Crooks is a Professor of Geography within the [Department of Geography](http://www.buffalo.edu/cas/geography.html) and a faculty member in the [RENEW Institute](http://www.buffalo.edu/renew.html) at the [University at Buffalo](http://www.buffalo.edu). Prior to joining the University at Buffalo he was an Assistant and then Associate Professor of Computational Social Science with a joint appointment between the Departments of Computational and Data Sciences and the Geography and GeoInformation Science at George Mason University. His areas of expertise specifically relate to integrating agent-based modelling and geographic information systems (GIS) to explore human behavior. Moreover, his research focuses on exploring and understanding the natural and socio-economic environments specifically urban areas using GIS, spatial analysis, social network analysis, social media, and agent-based modelling methodologies.

Nick Malleson is a Professor of Spatial Science at the [Centre for Spatial Analysis and Policy](www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/research/csap/) at the [School of Geography](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/geography), [University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/). His research is interdisciplinary and centers on the development and application of spatiotemporal computational models in the social sciences, with a particular focus on crime simulation and modelling. More recently, he has been conducting research that explores the nature of massive “crowd-sourced” data in the social sciences and related modelling approaches.

Ed Manley is a Professor of Urban Analytics in the [School of Geography](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/geography) at [University of Leeds](http://www.leeds.ac.uk/), and an affiliate of the [Leeds Institute for Data Analytics (LIDA)](https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/). Prior to joining the University of Leeds, Ed was an associate professor at the [Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/), University College London. His research involves measuring and modelling the individual and collective behaviours that shape urban dynamics, drawing on new streams of data and simulation methods. Ed is particularly interested in advancing data-driven agent-based modelling in order to improve the understanding and prediction of complex social systems.

Alison Heppenstall is Professor of Geocomputation within the [College of Social Sciences at the University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/colleges/socialsciences/), and an [Alan Turing Fellow](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers).  Prior to joining Glasgow, she was a Professor of Geocomputation in the 
[School of Geography](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/geography) at [University of Leeds](http://www.leeds.ac.uk/) and an associate of [Leeds Institute for Data Analytics (LIDA)](https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/). She is an expert in the development of spatial agent-based models (ABMs) with a focus on understanding and simulating behavior. Her current interests are concerned with linking ABMs to artificial intelligence and machine learning methodologies, the role of Big Data in creating more robust ABMs, and the application of ABMs to understanding the impact of sustainability policies on health inequalities.
